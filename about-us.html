         <h3 class="pdm-bottom20 font-weight600">About Hypno-Sensing</h3>
       </div>

       <div class="hypno-text pdm-top15">
         <p><span class="quate-sizes">â€œ</span> Many people have asked how I came up with the idea for Hypno-Sensing, so I decided to write a short summary, but it turned out longer than I anticipated,ðŸ˜‰but for anyone who is interested, here is how Hypno-Sensing came to beâ€¦</p>
         <h3 class="pdm-top20 font-weight600">Success was effortless when I was young. </h3>
         <p class="pdm-top10">I was advanced a year at school, had unconditional acceptances from LSE and Goldsmiths, easily learned three languages, had a successful business in Fulham at 26, and bought my first three-bedroom flat in West Kensington when I was 27. </p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">Much later, I discovered I owed my easy successes to the fact that I had very few unresolved emotions and, as a result, complete trust in my gut feelings, all thanks to the wonderful parents who made us believe we were valued and could achieve anything we put our minds to. </p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">From a young age, if a significant person upset me, I would feel compelled to confront the issue, at least until I felt some sort of resolution and the feeling went away. However, if a stranger, or someone I didnâ€™t like, upset me, I found it easy to shake the feeling off, concluding â€˜they were not worth bothering aboutâ€™. </p>

         <h3 class="pdm-top20 font-weight600">Either way, the upset feeling disappeared.</h3>

         <p class="pdm-top10">This simple approach to bothersome feelings served meâ€¦ until it didnâ€™t. For years I was in a relationship that was magicalâ€¦  until it wasnâ€™t. Overnight -or so it seemed- my knight in shining armour became an octopus of control and manipulation. After many discussions, I realised the â€˜promises to changeâ€™ were meaningless, but I was not prepared for what happened when I said I was leavingâ€¦  he calmy stated that if I did, he would â€˜jump off a bridge, with -a vulnerable relative I loved very much- in his armsâ€™.</p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">The chill I felt is impossible to describe in words â€“ life, as I knew it, was over. I suspected it was a bluff, but I no longer knew who this erratic, volatile person was. I could not risk even a 1% chance that something may tip him over the edge.</p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">The years that followed saw me plunge deeper and deeper into despair. I became completely unrecognisable from the feisty, fun-loving person I had been up until then. </p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">I eventually found the strength to leave some years later. But we still had to communicate, and the threats resurfaced via casual remarks and covert actions. My imagination went into overdrive, until I had no respite from feelings that alternated between fear, powerlessness and despair to rage, resentment, and hatred. I could find no escape from these feelings.</p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">I eventually had repeated panic attacks. One day, I collapsed in the street and was hospitalised for two weeks. I insisted it was stress, but the consultant was convinced there was a physical cause. The last test was a lumbar puncture, and I woke up next day with lower frequency hearing loss and horrendous, unbearable tinnitus. My hearing had always been superb; now I struggled to hear. The consultant claimed it was â€˜a coincidenceâ€™. I was discharged next day, ten X more stressed than when I was admitted. </p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">Unable to sleep, because of the horrendous tinnitus, I began searching online for something, anything that could help silence the dreadful noises. I remember it was around 4 a.m. when I came across an article about â€˜energy psychologyâ€™. I had tried traditional psychology, knowing stress can make tinnitus worse, but it was useless, but somehow, I instinctively felt that this could help. The explanation that <span class="fontstyle-italic">â€˜if we fail to resolve emotional upsets, the energy pattern of the unresolved feeling becomes trapped in our bodyâ€™s subtle energy system, disrupting the flow of vital energy, leading to all manner of physical and emotional problemsâ€™.</span> </p>

         <h3 class="pdm-top20 font-weight600">WOW! It was like a eureka moment!</h3>
         <p class="pdm-top10">By ten oâ€™clock that morning, I had booked an appointment with a top London energy psychologist. </p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">Half-way though the session, I already felt much calmer. By the end of the session there was an improvement in the tinnitus, but the silver lining had to be that I felt the old me had been released and was on the way back. I was skipping down the stairs when I left, and when I opened the outside door, it felt as if I was stepping into a new world! </p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">I was so impressed, I decided to become a practitioner of the most popular energy psychology techniques. However, when I began practising, I realised people often had hundreds of unresolved emotions, many of which had been successfully buried for decades.</p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">I understood the power of our subconscious mind, so I encouraged people to use the techniques regularly at home so they would get the reinforcement needed to rewrite their subconscious programming, but most complained they didnâ€™t get the same results.</p>

         <p class="pdm-top10 fontstyle-italic">Energy psychology techniques are advertised as being â€˜easy and effectiveâ€™. But using them effectively often requires great skill.</p>

         <p class="pdm-top10">However, I knew that once the trapped energy related to an upset feeling was successfully released, the feeling â€˜vanished like magicâ€™. What was needed, was a way to ensure that once the trapped feeing was released, it would not resurface days, or weeks later.</p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">After trying for months to find a way for people to get the same results when using the energy psychology techniques on their own, I woke one morning after having a dream about a completely new way of releasing the trapped energy from unresolved, buried feelings. I tried to remember the details, but what seemed crystal clear in my dream was now like â€˜will oâ€™ the wispâ€™.</p>
         <p class="pdm-top10">However, I was on a mission and determined to leave no stone unturned in my quest to retrieve the lost details from my dream. This led me to the work of visionaries like Lester Levensonâ€™s â€˜Release Techniqueâ€™, Dr David Berceliâ€™s â€˜Trauma Release Techniqueâ€™, Dr Peter Levineâ€™s â€˜Somatic Experiencingâ€™, and much, much more. I developed a keen interest in quantum physics, especially quantum entanglement, which seeming incredibly complex, is easy to â€˜getâ€™ at a gut level. I believe insights came from a much greater power, many via things I would feel inextricably drawn to -as if an unseen hand was guiding me. The journey took many years, but it was worth it â€“ waiting at the destination was the emotional transformation technique I have called â€˜Hypno-Sensingâ€™.</p>

         <h3 class="pdm-top20 font-weight600">Spoiler alert, Hypno-|Sensing is exceptionally effective! </h3>

         <p class="pdm-top10 fontstyle-italic">Aside: Hypno-Sensing is not hypnotherapy, but it is as effective as the best hypnotherapy. Many people donâ€™t like the idea of allowing someone to control their mind. Hypno-sensing allows you to get the same -or better- results while remaining fully in control of your mind.</p>
