<!--            <p>“ Hi. I’m Marjorie Green. I’ve spent the last 10+ years developing the emotional transformation technique ‘Hypno-Sensing’ – you can read more about Hypno-Sensing below.</p> -->
           <p class="pdm-top15">Prior to making it available globally, I would like as many people as possible to experience the latest version of Hypno-Sensing, so they can give me an honest review of their experience. The total time involved is approximately 90 minutes, and I guarantee that whatever problem you are experiencing you will feel more positive and more in control by the end of your session, following which you will notice positive changes in your life. The session can take place in situ [I am currently in Glasgow but will be back in London in a few months] or via Skype or Zoom [remote sessions are as effective as in-situ sessions]. At the end of your session, you will receive a copy of the recording that was made during your session for you to replay at home. </p>
           <p class="pdm-top15">Once I have around 50 testimonials, and have made any tweaks necessary, I will launch Hypno-Sensing globally. After the launch, the fee per session will be between £150 - £175.  However, as this is completely new and you will be providing me with an honest review of your experience of Hypno-Sensing -which is helpful to me- I leave it up to each person to pay what they can afford.</p>

         <p>Everything is energy, including our thoughts and feelings. Ancient Eastern traditions have known for millennia that physical and emotional wellbeing are only possible when the body’s subtle energy flows freely.  Until recently, Western science has refused to acknowledge the existence of this invisible energy. However, after esteemed Western scientists decreed that ‘everything in the Universe is made of patterns of vibrating energy’… including our body, and ourthoughts and feelings, there has been a sea change in the way upset feelings - unhappiness / depression / feeling ‘not good enough’ / anger / sadness / frustration / despair / anxiety, and bothersome feelings in general are treated. A new type of psychology emerged – ‘Energy Psychology’.</p>

       <div class="refused-energy">
         <p>Having studied the most effective of the new ‘energy psychology techniques’ to practitioner level, Marjorie Green [founder of Hypno-Sensing], believed there was something missing. While the techniques were advertised as being ‘easy to use’, she discovered that while the technical aspects were easy to use, using them effectively often required great skill. Marjorie says, “It wasn’t until I began studying the workings of our subconscious mind in more depth, that I realised how powerful our subconscious programming is. It made me realise that to ensure the feelings released using energy psychology techniques didn’t come back - as they often did -  it was necessary to rewrite the subconscious programming that fuelled the bothersome feelings.</p>

       <div class="refused-energy">
         <p>The problem was, traditionally, rewriting subconscious programming requires a lot of repetition and reinforcement - the very reason most talk therapy can take months, and in some cases years…if it’s successful.  Marjorie knew that when energy psychology techniques released the trapped energy related to buried / unresolved feelings, the effects were often miraculous and instantaneous. However, she also knew that the released feelings would often come back. Her goal was to find a way that would allow the trapped feelings to be released more permanently, in a way that would be easy for people to use. At first it seemed like an impossible task, but the journey became very interesting.</p>

         <p>Over the course of the next few years, Marjorie was influenced by luminaries such as Lester Levinson, Peter Levine, D C Nelson, Remote Viewing, Telepathy, Quantum entanglement and much, much, more… At first, her intention was to find a way to improve the existing energy psychology techniques she practiced, so people could get the necessary reinforcement, ensuring the released feelings did not come back.   Unfortunately, that was not possible, but she eventually came up with a completely new emotional transformation technique that was not only effective, but easy to use. The new technique not only allowed people to release the trapped energy related to their unresolved feelings, it also ensured the feelings would not come back. She called the technique Hypno-Sensing. </p>

            <p>Because of the success of her 1st Hypno-Sensing session, Nurcan felt confident to open-up about the problems she’d been experiencing for years with her husband’s family, who were English. She said she felt like an outsider and that they didn’t like her. We released the trapped, negative feelings she had and replaced them with feelings of how she would like things to be. I took her through an exercise I’d been developing that allowed her to send positive feelings from her heart to the hearts of her in-laws, without speaking a single word.  She continued to do the exercise at home, with the help of the recording from her session. She now realises her old perceptions were giving off negative vibes. Her relationship with her in-laws has transformed after just one session.</p>

          <p>In this video, Brenda describes the many changes that have taken place since her first Hypno-Sensing session – the many improvements in her eating patterns, the increase in her energy levels, and the fact that she is so much more focused and no longer procrastinates.</p>

          <h3 class="font-weight600 dark-blue">Brenda’s another Hypno-Sensing session</h3>
          <p>Prior to coming for her session, Brenda had experienced a traumatic, emotional set-back. Her normal way of dealing with such a set-back would have been to shut herself off and go into a downward spiral. Instead, she contacted me to ask if she could have another Hypno-Sensing session. I was delighted that she had taken the initiative to change her normal way of reacting. She recorded this video immediately after her third Hypno-Sensing session.</p>

        <p>In this video Mariola shares the changes she has noticed since her first Hypno-Sensing session. She discusses the increased self-awareness she has had, and above all the realisation that prior to her Hypno-Sensing session she had been judgmental and the positive changes she has noticed in her relationships since she has consciously addressed the issue.</p>

        <h3 class="font-weight600 dark-blue">Mariola’s another Hypno-Sensing session</h3>
        <p>After the success of her first Hypno-Sensing session, Mariola asked if she could have another session to deal with a specific problem she had been dealing with unsuccessfully for several months. In the video she discusses the problem and its surprising outcome, which she was convinced could only be because of the |Hypno-Sensing session she had days before. [During the session, I guided her through an exercise where she shared her heartfelt feelings with the other person ‘remotely’ – no words exchanged]. </p>

      <p>Earle was seeing me for bioresonance treatment following a traumatic brain injury he received as a child following a bad car accident. He had been through many operations during his life, and the NHS had decided there was no more they could do. I suspected he may have many trapped emotions arising from the accident and the impact it has had on his life. In this video, Earle relates his experience after his Hypno-Sensing session.</p>

        <p>‘Client X’ does not want to be identified due to the personal nature of her problem. I had been treating her with some success with bioresonance for Ulcerative Colitis/Crohn’s. I suspected emotional blocks were a key factor in her symptoms, and mentioned the emotional transformation technique I was developing. At first, she was reluctant as she believed she had dealt with her emotions through years of meditation. In the video, she discusses unexpected, but very welcome improvements. A happy footnote is that 18 months later, she gave birth to a healthy baby – something she feared may never happen.</p>

      <p>Bob is a good friend who was diagnosed with MS [Multiple Sclerosis] over 40 years ago. One of the main symptoms he suffers from is very low energy. We carried out his Hypno-Sensing session via Skype as he lives in Sussex and finds it difficult to travel. He recorded the video immediately after his session. I spoke to him yesterday and was very pleased to see that not only has he continued to improve, I told him I thought he was looking younger!</p>

        <p>Deanne was a bioresonance client. At one point I mentioned the emotional transformation technique I’d been working on for several years, and asked her if she had any emotional issues she would like to work on. She was at first reluctant – she had been doing yoga and meditating for years and felt her emotions were quite balanced. But she decided she would like to ‘give it a go’. In the video, she discusses the benefits she has noticed following her session. </p>
